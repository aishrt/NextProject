This is a Next.js authentication configuration file using the next-auth library. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing dependencies

The code imports the following dependencies:

User model from @/models/user.model
next-auth library and its types
bcryptjs library for password hashing
db utility from @/utils/connectDB for database connection
Defining authentication options

The code defines an object authOptions that contains the authentication configuration. This object is used to customize the behavior of next-auth.

Session strategy

The session property defines the session strategy. In this case, it's set to "jwt", which means that the session will be stored in a JSON Web Token (JWT). The maxAge property sets the maximum age of the session to 1 day.

Callbacks

The callbacks property defines two callback functions:

jwt: This function is called when a JWT is generated. It takes the token, account, and profile as arguments. If the account object is present and its type is "credentials", it sets the userId property of the token object to the providerAccountId of the account object.
session: This function is called when a session is generated. It takes the session, token, and user as arguments. It connects to the database, finds the user with the userId stored in the token object, and sets the user property of the session object to the found user.
Pages

The pages property defines a custom signin page path, which is set to /auth/login.

Providers

The providers property defines an array of authentication providers. In this case, there is only one provider, which is an instance of the Credentials provider from next-auth/providers/credentials.

The Credentials provider is configured with the following properties:

name: The name of the provider, which is set to "Credentials".
credentials: An object that defines the credentials that will be requested from the user. In this case, it requests a username and a password.
authorize: A function that is called to authorize the user. It takes the credentials and req as arguments. It connects to the database, finds the user with the provided username, and checks the password using bcrypt.compare. If the password is invalid or the user is not found, it throws an error. If the user is found and the password is valid, it returns the user object.
getServerAuthSession

The getServerAuthSession function is a wrapper around the getServerSession function from next-auth. It takes the authOptions object as an argument and returns the result of calling getServerSession with those options.

In summary, this code sets up an authentication system using next-auth with a custom signin page, a JWT-based session strategy, and a credentials-based authentication provider that checks the user's password using bcrypt.
